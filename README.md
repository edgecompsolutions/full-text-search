Data is indexed in JSON and images/documents will be stored in cost-effective cloud storage. Users could retrieve the images/documents through secured APIs. The search performance is extremely fast and having unmatched performance than common database query! 

### Case Studies

- Some examples of how full-text search has been used specifically for Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) use cases in the manufacturing industry:

**Samsung**: Samsung implemented a full-text search system to help its engineers quickly search through AOI images and data collected during the manufacturing process. The system allows engineers to search for specific defects or anomalies, reducing the time spent on manual inspection and improving the accuracy of defect detection.

**Foxconn**: Foxconn, a leading manufacturer of electronic components, implemented a full-text search system to help its quality control team analyze AOI data and identify defects. The system allows team members to quickly search through thousands of images and identify patterns or trends that may indicate a problem with a specific component or manufacturing process.

**Huawei**: Huawei uses a full-text search system to analyze AOI data and identify defects in its electronic components. The system allows engineers to quickly search through images and identify defects that may be difficult to spot with the naked eye.

**Flex**: Flex, a global electronics manufacturing services provider, implemented a full-text search system to help its engineers and technicians analyze AOI data and identify defects. The system allows them to quickly search through images and identify patterns or trends that may indicate a problem with a specific component or manufacturing process.

**Jabil**: Jabil, a leading provider of manufacturing services, implemented a full-text search system to help its quality control team analyze AOI data and identify defects. The system allows team members to quickly search through images and identify defects that may be missed during manual inspection.
